== btparser 0.7

What's new:
- Small code cleanups
- Two tests were added

== btparser 0.6
Released 2010-09-23.

Changes:
- Functions btp_frame_eq* were renamed to provide cleaner interface.
- Parameter `shallow` in functions btp_backtrace_dup, btp_thread_dup,
  btp_frame_dup has been removed to simplify the interface.
- Interfaces of parser functions were modified to return
  structures/NULL instead of bool.

Bugs fixed:
- A compilation issue on 64-bit architecture with a fprintf
  call using %d instead of %zd.

See the ChangeLog file for more details.

== btparser 0.5
Released 2010-08-31.

What's new:
- If the last frame has address 0x0000 and its name is '??', its
  remove during backtrace normalization. This fixes rhbz#592523.

== btparser 0.4
Released 2010-08-30.

What's new:
- RPM spec file has been added
- 'make rpm' and 'make srpm' works for testing purposes

== btparser 0.3
Released 2010-08-30.

What's new:
- the interface documentation has been extended
- a proper README file was created
- a pkg-config metadata file support has been added
- some autotest code was added

== btparser 0.2
Released 2010-08-27.

What's new:
- the API has been extensively reworked and simplified; user can call
  the function btp_backtrace_quality_complex to get the quality of
  the backtrace, function btp_backtrace_get_duplication_hash to get
  the hash, and function btp_backtrace_get_crash_frame to get the
  place where the program crashed
- location support: in the case of failure, the backtrace parser
  reports line and column of the input string where the failure
  occurred and a message describing what input was expected
- the command line options of the btparser utitity has been reduced
  and simplified; you can now run `btparser file.bt --duplicate-hash`
  to get the hash
- the normalization code was significantly improved; this results in
  better backtrace hash quality

=== Duplication hash quality
The hash quality has been significantly improved since btparser 0.1:

./btparser-bz-improvetips: 3092 duplicates out of total 8051
duplicates were _not_ recognized by btparser

=== Parser precision
When compared to abrt-backtrace utility, the btparser's parser
provides better results.  In a test comparing the parser results on
25685 backtraces, btparser was "better" in 726 cases.

=== Parser speed
The btparser's parser is slightly slower than abrt-backtrace's parser.

Measurement of how long it takes to parse 25685 backtraces:
 btparser took 192.070000 seconds
 abrt-backtrace took 181.230000 seconds

== btparser 0.1
Released 2010-06-15.

Here is how btparser's hand-written parser became as good as
abrt-backtrace's bison parser on 2010-05-28:

initial
 -> parser quality: 1540 regressions out of 9015

newline allowed after function name in frame header
 -> parser quality: 1391 regressions out of 9015

nonrecursive braces (with spaces) allowed in function name
 -> parser quality: 1216 regressions out of 9015

recursive templates and braces, skip Python backtraces
 -> parser quality: 336 regressions out of 9015

manually marking backtraces where the difference is caused by better
parser btparser
 -> parser quality: 98 regressions out of 9015, 164 times was btparser
    better

support for operator> and similar
 -> parser quality: 65 regressions out of 9015, 185 times was btparser
    better

support for type before function name and some more backtrace marking
 -> parser quality: 59 regressions out of 9015, 191 times was btparser
    better

various small fixes of corner cases
 -> parser quality: 0 regressions out of 9015, 241 times was btparser better

btparser took 101.650000 seconds, abrt-backtrace took 105.260000 seconds

=== Duplication hash quality
./btparser-bz-improvetips: 3976 duplicates out of total 7668
duplicates were not recognized by btparser.
