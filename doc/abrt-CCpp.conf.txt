NAME
----
abrt-CCpp.conf - Configuration file for ABRT's core dump crash hook

SYNOPSIS
--------
/etc/abrt/plugins/CCpp.conf

DESCRIPTION
-----------
The configuration file consists of items in the format "Option = Value".
Ithe following items are recognized:

MakeCompatCore = 'yes' / 'no' ...::
   CCpp hook writes its template to the "/proc/sys/kernel/core_pattern" file
   and stores the original template in the "/var/run/abrt/saved_core_pattern"
   file. If you want CCpp hook to create a core dump file named according to
   the original template as well, set 'MakeCompatCore' to 'yes'.
   If the original template string starts with "|", the string "core" is used
   instead of the template.
   For more information about naming core dump files see 'man 5 core'.

MaxCoreFileSize = 'a number in MiB' ...::
   This configuration option together with MaxCrashReportsSize set the limit on
   the size of dumped core file. The lower value of the both options is used as
   the effective limit. 0 is evaluated as unlimited for the both options.

SaveBinaryImage = 'yes' / 'no' ...::
   Do you want a copy of crashed binary be saved?
   Useful, for example, when _deleted binary_ segfaults.
   Default is 'no'.

JITCoreDumpTracing = 'yes' / 'no' ...::
   When enabled, stack traces are generated by abrt-hook-ccpp as the kernel
   creates core dumps. Only the crash thread is stored. This feature requires
   kernel version 3.18.
   Default is 'yes'.

SaveFullCore = 'yes' / 'no' ...::
   Save full coredump? If set to 'no', coredump won't be saved
   and you won't be able to report the crash to Bugzilla. Only
   useful with 'JITCoreDumpTracing' set to 'yes'. Please
   note that if this option is set to 'no' and MakeCompatCore
   is set to 'yes', the core is still written to the current
   directory.
   Default is 'yes'.

IgnoredPaths = /path/to/ignore/*, */another/ignored/path* ...::
   ABRT will ignore crashes in executables whose absolute path matches
   any of the glob patterns listed in the comma separated list.

AllowedUsers = root, wheel, ...::
   ABRT will process only crashes of either allowed users 'AllowedUsers' or
   users who are members of allowed group 'AllowedGroups'. If no allowed users
   nor allowed group are specified ABRT will process crashes of all users.
   'AllowedUsers' is a comma separated list.

AllowedGroups = root, wheel, ...::
   ABRT will process only crashes of either allowed users 'AllowedUsers' or
   users who are members of allowed group 'AllowedGroups'. If no allowed users
   nor allowed group are specified ABRT will process crashes of all users.
   'AllowedGroups' is a comma separated list.

VerboseLog = NUM::
   Used to make the hook more verbose
