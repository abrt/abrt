NAME
----
abrtd - automated bug reporting tool's daemon.

SYNOPSIS
--------
'abrtd' [-dsv[v]...]

DESCRIPTION
-----------
'abrtd' is a daemon that watches for application crashes. When a crash occurs,
it collects the problem data (core file, application's command line etc.) and
takes action according to the type of application that crashed and according to
the configuration in the 'abrt.conf' config file. There are plugins for various
actions: for example to report the crash to Bugzilla, to mail the report, or to
transfer the report via FTP or SCP. See the manual pages for the respective
plugins.

OPTIONS
-------
-v::
   Log more detailed debugging information.

-d::
   Stay in the foreground and log to standard error.

-s::
   Log to system log even with option -d.

-t NUM::
   Exit after NUM seconds of inactivity.

-p::
   Add program names to log.

ENVIRONMENT
-----------
ABRT_EVENT_NICE::
  'abrtd' runs its post-mortem processing with the nice value incremented by 10
  in order to not take too much resources and keep the computer responsive.  If
  you want to adjust the increment value, use the ABRT_EVENT_NICE environment
  variable.

CAVEATS
-------
When you use some other crash-catching tool specific for an application or an
application type (for example BugBuddy for GNOME applications), crashes of this
type will be handled by that tool and not by 'abrtd'. If you want 'abrtd' to
handle these crashes, turn off the higher-level crash-catching tool.
