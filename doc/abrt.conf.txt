NAME
----
abrt.conf - Configuration file for ABRT.

SYNOPSIS
--------
/etc/abrt/abrt.conf

DESCRIPTION
-----------
'ABRT' is a daemon that watches for application crashes. When a crash occurs, it
collects the problem data and takes action according to its configuration. This
document describes ABRT's configuration file.

The configuration file consists of items in the format "Option = Value".
A description of each item follows:

*DumpLocation = 'directory'*::
   The directory where ABRT should store coredumps and other files which are
   needed for reporting.
   +
   Default is '/var/spool/abrt'.

*MaxCrashReportsSize = 'number'*::
   The maximum disk space (specified in MiB) that ABRT will use for all the
   crash dumps. Specify a value here to ensure that the crash dumps will not
   fill all available storage space.
   +
   Default is 5000.

*WatchCrashdumpArchiveDir = 'directory'*::
   The daemon will watch this directory and call 'abrt-handle-upload' on files
   which appear there. This is used to auto-unpack crashdump tarballs uploaded
   via FTP, SCP, etc. The directory must exist and be writable for 'abrt'.
   +
   Example: /var/spool/abrt-upload
   +
   Default is none, hence the feature is disabled.

*DeleteUploaded = 'yes/no'*::
   The daemon will delete an uploaded crashdump archive after an atempt to
   unpack it. An archive will be delete whether unpacking finishes successfully
   or not.
   +
   Default value is 'no'.

*DebugLevel = '0-100'*::
   Allows ABRT tools to detect problems in ABRT itself. By increasing the value
   you can force ABRT to detect, process and report problems in ABRT. You have
   to bare in mind that ABRT might fall into an infinite loop when handling
   problems caused by itself.
   +
   Default is 0 (non debug mode).

*AutoreportingEnabled = 'yes/no'*::
   Enables automatic execution of the event configured in 'AutoreportingEvent'
   option.
   +
   Default is 'no'.

*AutoreportingEvent = 'event'*::
   A name of event which is run automatically after problem's detection. The
   event should perform some fast analysis and exit with 70 if the
   problem is known.
   +
   Default is 'report_uReport'.

*ShortenedReporting = 'yes/no'*::
   Enables shortened GUI reporting where the reporting is interrupted after
   AutoreportingEvent is done.
   +
   Default is 'yes' if application is running in a GNOME desktop session;
   otherwise it's 'no'.

*ExploreChroots = 'yes/no'*::
   Enables various features exploring process's root directories if they differ
   from the default root directory. The folowing list includes examples of
   enabled features:
     * query the rpm database in the process's root directory
     * save files like /etc/os-release from the process's root directory
   +
   Default is 'no'.
