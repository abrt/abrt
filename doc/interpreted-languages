This document describes the interaction between ABRT and interpreted
languages.

Interpreted language is a programming language where the programs
written in that language are not translated into the machine code of
the computer it is on, but interpreted by another software program
known as an interpreter.

In order to handle interpreted language correctly, ABRT needs a hook
in the language's interpreter. The hook catches serious application
misbehaviors (such as uncaught exceptions, invalid bytecode, missing
library) inside the interpreter and reports the misbehaviors to
ABRT. Hook is usually responsible for assembling the backtrace.

Another issue are the crashes of the interpreter, which are caught by
the CCpp plugin.  When the support for specific interpreter is missing
all these crashes are reported to the interpreter component when
submitting the crash using Bugzilla plugin, regardless of application
executed by the interpreter. To change this, the interpreter should be
handled in src/Daemon/MiddleWare.cpp (see how it is done for Python).

ABRT currently support only CPython interpreter (the mainstream Python
implementation). Perl, Java, Ruby, and Mono interpreter hooks are yet
to be written. It might be necessary to modify ABRT to support a new
interpreter (patches welcomed).

Communication between ABRT and hooks
====================================

Hook might be a binary plugin plugged to the interpreter, or it might
be interpreted by the interpreter in the same way as the applications
When some event which should be caught by ABRT occurs and is detected
by the hook, the hook reports it to ABRT using ABRT daemon's socket
file.  ABRT then creates a new directory describing the crash in
/var/tmp/abrt.

The ABRT's CCpp plugin does not use the socket file, but it creates
crash data directory in /var/tmp/abrt directly. Interpreted hooks
must not report crashes this way, because SELinux blocks interpreter
access to /var/tmp/abrt and this access can not be granted due to
security issues.

ABRT socket file resides in /var/run/abrt.socket. Hooks should open
this socket for writing, write the event information, and close the
socket. If the hook leaves the socket opened for a long time without
writing anything, the ABRT daemon which listens on the other side will
close the connection. The maximum number of concurrently opened socket
sessions is also limited.

The event data are sent to the socket in a number of fields in format
"FIELDNAME=VALUE\0". Various fields impose various restrictions on the
format of VALUE, but generally the VALUE might contain all characters
except \0. Hook sends "DONE\0" after the last field to finish the
entry creation process in the daemon. All fields are mandatory. Field
order does not matter.

Fields
======

PID
Process id of the running interpreter.

EXECUTABLE
The file with the main entry point of the application. Might be a JAR
archive, a script file, a bytecode file, or the interpreter. It should
be a real file on the filesystem, so ABRT can check the origin of the
file (source package). If the file is not known, the most appropriate
is to shortly describe the reason why it is not known in the field.
However, exceptions raised from interactive shell (a common reason
for unknown file) are hardly useful and should not be reported.

ANALYZER
The name of an analyzer plugin which should be run during the
analysis. It is used to choose appropriate method of post processing
for the crash dump. Sensible names are "python", "perl", "java" etc.

BASENAME
Short string indicating the origin of the event. It is used as a part
of directory name: /var/tmp/abrt/BASENAME-suffix. Use "python" for
Python exceptions, "ruby" for ruby interpreter, "java" for JRE.

REASON
A short, one line string describing the event. For Python it is
something like "CCMainWindow.py:1:<module>:ZeroDivisionError: integer
division or modulo by zero".

BACKTRACE
The backtrace at the moment of the crash, if it is available.  May
include other useful information.  For example, for ccpp crashes, it
includes register dump. The backtrace should be in a format that is
commonly used by the interpreter.

Here is an example of a crash report from Python, as it is written to
the socket:
PID=563\0
EXECUTABLE=/usr/bin/python\0
ANALYZER=Python\0
BASENAME=pyhook\0
REASON=CReporterAssistant.py:415:on_plugin_toggled:ValueError: list.remove(x):
x not in list\0
BACKTRACE=Traceback (most recent call last):
