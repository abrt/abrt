SYNOPSIS

DESCRIPTION

The tool reads the file named 'Xorg.0.log' and checks if any black listed
module was loaded. If so, 'not-reportable' file is created with an appropriate
explanation text. If no black listed module was loaded, the tool reads the
file named 'backtrace' from a problem data directory record and generates a
duplication hash and a universally unique identifier (UUID). Then it saves
this data as new elements 'duphash' and 'uuid'.
