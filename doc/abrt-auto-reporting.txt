abrt-auto-reporting(1)
======================

NAME
----
abrt-auto-reporting - Get or modify a value of the auto reporting option

SYNOPSIS
--------
'abrt-auto-reporting' [-v] [ enabled | yes | 1 | disabled | no | 0 ]

DESCRIPTION
-----------
Reads the configuration from abrt.conf and saves the changes to the same file.

The changes will take effect immediately without necessity to restart any ABRT
process and will be persistent.

'disabled'::
   User have to report the detect problems manually

'enabled'::
   ABRT uploads an uReport which was generated for a detected problem
   immediately after the detection phase.

uReport description
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
ABRT supports uReports for four types of crashes: crashes of C/C++ programs
that result in a core dump, uncaught Python exceptions, uncaught Java
exceptions and kernel oopses.

Each uReport generally contains a stack trace, or multiple stack traces in the
case of multi-threaded C/C++ and Java programs. The stack trace only describes
the call stack of the program at the time of the crash and does not contain
contents of any variables.

Every uReport also contains identification of the operating system, versions of
the RPM packages involved in the crash, and whether the program ran under a
root user.

There are also items specific to each crash type:

C/C++ crashes::
    these are path to the executable and signal delivered to the program,

Python exceptions::
    there is the type of the exception (without the error message, which may
    contain sensitive data),

for kernel oopses::
    these are list of loaded kernel modules, list of taint flags, and full text
    of the kernel oops.

'Warning':
The full text of a kernel oops might contain information like the
identification of the host hardware type. You should disable the autoreporting
feature if you do not want to share this information with Red Hat.
