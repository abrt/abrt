    <name>Analyze C/C++ Crash</name>
    <_description>Send core dump to remote retrace server for analysis or perform local analysis if the remote analysis fails</_description>
    <_long-description>Uploads coredump to a server, which generates backtrace and returns it. If user doesn't want to upload his coredump to anywhere the event performs local analysis. Local analysis is run event if remote analysis fails.
    Pros: no need for debuginfo downloads. Retrace server's database of debuginfos is more complete. Retrace server may generate better backtraces.
    Cons: coredump you upload contains all the data from the crashed program, including your private data, if any.

    <!-- The event shows a message about sensitive data on its own.
         It has to ask user on its own because other tools interrupts
         processing at all if user rejects sending of sensitive data.
         The second result for showing the question on its own is that the
         event implementation automatically runs the analyze_LocalGDB event if
         user dismisses the analyze_RetraceServer event. -->
