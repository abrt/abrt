# Configuration file for CCpp hook

# CCpp hook writes its template to the "/proc/sys/kernel/core_pattern" file
# and stores the original template in the "/var/run/abrt/saved_core_pattern"
# file. If you want CCpp hook to create a core dump file named according to
# the original template as well, set 'MakeCompatCore' to 'yes'.
# If the original template string starts with "|", the string "core" is used
# instead of the template.
# For more information about naming core dump files see 'man 5 core'.
#
# 'no' because of RLIMIT_CORE='unlimited' since systemd-229:
#   https://github.com/systemd/systemd/issues/2643
MakeCompatCore = no

# Do you want a copy of crashed binary be saved?
# (useful, for example, when _deleted binary_ segfaults)
SaveBinaryImage = no

# When this option is set to 'yes', core backtrace is generated
# from the memory image of the crashing process. Only the crash
# thread is present in the backtrace. This feature requires
# kernel 3.18 or newer, otherwise the core backtrace is not
# created.
CreateCoreBacktrace = yes

# Save full coredump? If set to 'no', coredump won't be saved
# and you won't be able to report the crash to Bugzilla. Only
# useful with CreateCoreBacktrace set to 'yes'. Please
# note that if this option is set to 'no' and MakeCompatCore
# is set to 'yes', the core is still written to the current
# directory.
SaveFullCore = yes

# Used for debugging the hook
#VerboseLog = 2

# Specify directories where ABRT should look for non-system debuginfos.
#
# Add a colon separated list of file system paths.
#
# Beware the first path in the list is used by ABRT to save downloaded
# debuginfos, therefore the first path in the list must be _writable_, the
# rest of the list can be read-only.
#
# (default: /var/cache/abrt-di)
#
#DebuginfoLocation = /var/cache/abrt-di

# Specify Package manager used for downloading of debuginfo packages
# Allowed values are: yum, dnf
# Default value is: @DEFAULT_PACKAGE_MANAGER@
#
# PackageManager = @DEFAULT_PACKAGE_MANAGER@

# Allow the hook to run 'rpm -qf' for crashes in containers
#
# SaveContainerizedPackageData = yes

# Standalone hook tells abrt-hook-ccpp to create a dump directory even if abrtd
# is not running.
#
# StandaloneHook = yes

# ABRT will ignore crashes in executables whose absolute path matches
# one of any of the glob patterns listed in the comma separated list.
#
# For example:
#    IgnoredPaths = /path/to/ignore/*, */another/ignored/path*
#
#IgnoredPaths =

# ABRT will process only crashes of either allowed users or users who are
# members of allowed group. If no allowed users nor allowed group are specified
# ABRT will process crashes of all users. Both AllowedUsers and AllowedGroups
# are a comma sepparated list.
#
# For example:
#    AllowedUsers = root, wheel, ...
#    AllowedGroups = root, wheel, ...
#
#AllowedUsers =
#AllowedGroups =
