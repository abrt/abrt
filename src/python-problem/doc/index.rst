abrt-python
===========

High-level API for querying, creating and manipulating
problems handled by `ABRT <https://github.com/abrt/abrt/>`_ 
in Python.

It works on top of low-level DBus or socket API provided
by ABRT. Socket API serves only as a fallback option
for systems without new DBus problem API
as it can only handle the creation of new problems.

This project lives in the
`abrt repository <https://github.com/abrt/abrt.git>`_ 
and is distributed under GPLv2 license.
