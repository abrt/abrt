abrt_event.conf(5)
==================

NAME
----
abrt_event.conf - configuration file for ABRT.

DESCRIPTION
-----------
This configuration file specifies which programs should be run
when the specified event occurs in dump directory lifetime.

It consists of directives and rules.

Directives start with a reserved word. Currently, there is
only one directive, "include".

include 'FILE'::
   This directive causes files which match FILE to be read
   and parsed as if they are inserted textually where this directive
   occurs.
   FILE can use shell pattern metacharacters (*,?,etc) to specify
   multiple files. Relative paths are interpreted relative to current
   file.

Rule starts with a line with non-space leading character.
All subsequent lines which start with space or tab form one rule.
Note that separating newline is retained.

Rules may be commented out with #. One # is sufficient to comment out
even a multi-line rule (no need to comment out every line).

Rules specify which programs to run on the dump directory.
Each rule may have conditions to be checked before the program is run.

Conditions have form VAR=VAL or VAL~=REGEX, where VAR is either
word "EVENT" or a name of dump directory element to be checked
(for example, "executable", "package", hostname" etc).

If all conditions match, the remaining part of the rule
(the "program" part) is run in the shell.
All shell language constructs are valid.
All stdout and stderr output is captured and passed to ABRT
and possibly to ABRT's frontends and shown to the user.

If the program terminates with nonzero exit code,
the event processing is considered unsuccessful and is stopped.
Last captured output line, if any, is considered to be
the error message indicating the reason of the failure,
and may be used by abrt as such.

If the program terminates successfully, next rule is read
and processed. This process is repeated until the end of this file.
