# How to install

### Development dependencies

Build dependencies can be listed by:

    $ ./autogen.sh sysdeps

or installed by:

    $ ./autogen.sh sysdeps --install

The dependency installer gets the data from [the rpm spec file](abrt.spec.in)

### Building from sources

When you have all dependencies installed run the following commands:

    $ ./autogen.sh --prefix=/usr \
                   --sysconfdir=/etc \
                   --localstatedir=/var \
                   --sharedstatedir=/var/lib

    $ make

or if you want to debug ABRT run:

    $ CFLAGS="-g -g3 -ggdb -ggdb3 -O0" ./autogen.sh --prefix=/usr \
                                                    --sysconfdir=/etc \
                                                    --localstatedir=/var \
                                                    --sharedstatedir=/var/lib \
                                                    --enable-debug

    $ make

### Installing

If you need an rpm package, run:

    $ make rpm

otherwise run:

    $ make install

(Note: If the build is failing, see if you don't have an older version of python3-abrt-addon already installed and try uninstalling the package as it might interfere with the build testsuite.)

On platforms with SELinux enabled, the 'make install' command must be followed
by the 'restorecon /' command. This is not required when installing rpm
packages because rpm's selinux plugin takes care of it.
