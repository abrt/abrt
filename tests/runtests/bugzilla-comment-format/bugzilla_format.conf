# Lines starting with # are ignored.
# Lines can be continued on the next line using trailing backslash.
#
# Format:
# %summary:: summary format
# section:: element1[,element2]...
# The literal text line to be added to Bugzilla comment. Can be empty.
# (IOW: empty lines are NOT ignored!)
#
# Summary format is a line of text, where %element% is replaced by
# text element's content, and [[...%element%...]] block is used only if
# %element% exists. [[...]] blocks can nest.
#
# Sections can be:
# - %summary: bug summary format string.
# - %attach: a list of elements to attach.
# - text, double colon (::) and the list of comma-separated elements.
#
# Elements can be:
# - problem directory element names, which get formatted as
#   <element_name>: <contents>
#   or
#   <element_name>:
#   :<contents>
#   :<contents>
#   :<contents>
# - problem directory element names prefixed by "%bare_",
#   which is formatted as-is, without "<element_name>:" and colons
# - %oneline, %multiline, %text wildcards, which select all corresponding
#   elements for output or attachment
# - %binary wildcard, valid only for %attach section, instructs to attach
#   binary elements
# - problem directory element names prefixed by "-",
#   which excludes given element from all wildcards
#
#   Nonexistent elements are silently ignored.
#   If none of elements exists, the section will not be created.
